These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/spiMemory_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/spiMemory_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Note: The tale above is a preliminary report that shows the Block RAMs at the current stage of the synthesis flow. Some Block RAMs may be reimplemented as non Block RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated Block RAMs are reported only once.

INFO: [Synth 8-4480] The timing for the instance i_2/spi_mem/memory_reg (implemented as a block RAM) might be sub-optimal as no optional output register could be merged into the block ram. Providing additional output register may help in improving timing.
